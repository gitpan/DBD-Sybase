Release 0.19

	Setting chained/non-chained mode was still broken. <sigh>
	syb_flush_finish mode didn't quite work right either.
	Added more verbose traces.

Release 0.18

	Add $h->{syb_chained_txn} attribute to switch between CHAINED
	transactions and explicit named transactions for AutoCommit=0
	mode. The default is for syb_chained_txn to be off (ie 0.13 behaviour).
	Fixed typo in syb_db_commit() to actually commit instead of doing
	a rollback.
	Added an autocommit.t test (which still needs some work).
	Disable opening new connection for secondary $sth handles off of a
	single $dbh handle when AutoCommit == 0.

Release 0.17

	Fix AutoCommit = 0 problems introduced with 0.15 for MS-SQL or older
	Sybase server (ie TDS 4.x protocol connections).
	Add syb_dynamic_supported $dbh attribute to check whether the 
	connection supports ?-style placeholders.

Release 0.16

	Added code to define PL_xxx symbols for pre 5.005 perls.
	New syb_flush_finish attribute (contributed by Steve Miller).
	Patch to Makefile.PL for VMS systems.
	Better library detection code in Makefile.PL.

Release 0.15

	Added an error handler callback which can intercept error messages
	and provide ad-hoc handling of error situations.
	In AutoCommit == 0 mode, use CS_OPT_CHAINXACTS mode on the 
	server instead of issuing explicit transactions.
	$dbh->LongReadLen and LongTruncOK now work.
	First cut at the type_info() and type_info_all() methods.
	perl Makefile.PL now attempts to discover the libraries directly
	based on what it finds in $SYBASE/lib.

Release 0.14

	Added a 'timeout' connection attribute (contributed by Tom May) 
	to handle timeout errors during normal processing.
	SQL PRINT statements are now handled by a warn() call (instead
	a printf() call) so that they can be caught by a __WARN__ handler.
        Make sure $dbh->do() returns immediately when an error is encountered.
	Include dbd-sybase.pod (Tim Bunce's Driver Summary for DBD::Sybase).

Release 0.13

	Bug fix release - binding undef (NULL) variables when using
	? style placeholders didn't work.
	Incorrect login didn't get flagged properly (this bug was
	introduced in 0.11.)
	Added database attribute to the connect() call.

Release 0.12

	Bug fix release - recent versions of DBI make an array that
	DBD::Sybase uses read-only, causing errors when multiple
	result sets are retrieved where the second result set is wider 
	(has more columns) than the first one.

Release 0.11

	Adds support for multiple $sth for a single $dbh (this is done 
	by openeing a new connection in prepare() if the previously
	prepared statement is still active.
	Add support for date formatting via $dbh->func($fmt,
	'_date_fmt').
	Added two new connect attributes: scriptName and
	hostname. Setting these can help identify processes in the
	Sybase sysprocesses table.

Release 0.10

	Fixes stupid Makefile.PL bug.
	Fixes incorrect freeing of memory when mixing prepare() 
	statements with ? placeholders and prepare() statements
	without them.

Release 0.09

	Features:

	Added $sth->{syb_result_type} which returns the numerical
	value of the current result set. The values are defined
	in $SYBASE/include/cspublic.h.
	Made $sth->{TYPE} compatible with generic DBI values, and
	added $sth->{syb_types} to get the native Sybase types.
	Added $dbh->tables and $dbh->table_info.

	Finally got rid of the "Use of uninitialized value" message 
	in connect() (thanks to Tom May for this)

	Fixed at least some of the memory leaks (thanks to Bryan Mawhinney)

	Added Sybase specific do() sub that will handle multiple result
	sets.

	Added $dbh->{syb_show_sql} and $dbh->{syb_show_eed} to add more
	control to error reporting.

	Implemented $dbh->ping() method (first cut - may need improvement!)

	Bug Fixes:

	244: fetch gets infinite loop on sproc error
	246: extended error messages go to STDOUT.

Release 0.08

	Features:

	Added ? placeholder processing. This is done by calling ct_dynamic() 
	and friends if the statement being executed includes ? type 
	placeholders.

	Bug Fixes:

	210: print statements are lost
	231: error messages are lost
	238: reformat error messages
	241: remove the necessity for users to call $sth->finish

Release 0.07
	
	Bug fixes:

	204: One form of DBI->connect() fails when specifying the server name.
	211: $dbh->do("use database") fails with RaiseError is true.
	230: fetch() does not return correct results for certain stored
	     procs situations.

Release 0.06

	Added ability to specify interfaces file in the connect() 
	call.
	Added eg/dbschema.pl (ported from Sybase::DBlib).
	Fixed incorrect handling of AutoCommit and PrintError
	attributes to connect().

	Bugs fixed:

	203: Executing sp_helprotect fails.

Release 0.05

	Added explicit assignement of LDDLFLAGS and LDFLAGS in 
	Makefile.PL to make sure that -L$SYBASE/lib comes first
	in the list of -L flags.
	Added documentation.
	Added ability to specify character set, language, packet size
	in the connect() call.
	Small Win32 portability patch to Makefile.PL from Matt Herbert.

        Bugs fixed:

	198: connect failure does not return undef
	199: DBD::Sybase interaction with Apache::DBI 0.74

Release 0.04

	Fixed counting of active statement handles.
	Add implicit rollback of open transactions on disconnect.
	Add implicit commit when changing AutoCommit from off to on.

Release 0.03
	
	First ALPHA release of native DBD::Sybase implementation.

Release 0.02

	Some fixes to the emulation layer.

Release 0.01

	Proof of concept release - built as an emulation layer on top
	of Sybase::CTlib (part of sybperl 2.x).
