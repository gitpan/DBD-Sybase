# DBI_INCLUDE
# DBD::Sybase needs access to some C include files that are provided
# by the DBI module. These are normally found in $Config{sitearchexp}/auto/DBI
# but if they are in some other place on your system then you can specify
# that directory here:
# DBI_INCLUDE=/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/sun4-solaris/auto/DBI


# LINKTYPE
# If you wish to link DBD::Sybase statically
# into perl uncomment the line below and run the make normally. Then,
# when you run 'make test' a new perl binary will be built.
#LINKTYPE=static
