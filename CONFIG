# Configuration file for Sybperl
#
# Where is the Sybase directory on your system (include files &
# libraries are expected to be found at SYBASE/include & SYBASE/lib
SYBASE=/opt/sybase

# Additional libraries.
# Some systems require -lnsl or -lBSD.
# Solaris 2.x needs -ltli
# DEC OSF/1 needs -ldnet_stub and may need -lsdna
# SunOS 4.x needs -linsck
# HP-UX 10.x needs -linsck
# AIX 3.2.5 needs -linsck
# Linux needs -lsybtcl and -linsck
# See the Sybase OpenClient Supplement for your OS/Hardware
# combination.
EXTRA_LIBS=-ltli

# DBI_INCLUDE
# DBD::Sybase needs access to some C include files that are provided
# by the DBI module. These are normally found in $Config{sitearchexp}/auto/DBI
# but if they are in some other place on your system then you can specify
# that directory here:
# DBI_INCLUDE=/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/sun4-solaris/auto/DBI


# LINKTYPE
# If you wish to link DBD::Sybase statically
# into perl uncomment the line below and run the make normally. Then,
# when you run 'make test' a new perl binary will be built.
#LINKTYPE=static
